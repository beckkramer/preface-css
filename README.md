# Preface

This is intended to act as a simple starting point for CSS for new projects. General spacing, font, and pattern rules are in place with a nod towards simple scalability and single responsibility CSS.

In a perfect world, a majority of adjustment will only need to happen in the `base` files and filter down elsewhere, but your implementation may need to drill deeper. If such need arises, it's reccomended to add on to variables and rules in the base files, rather than introduce values deeper in your file structure.
